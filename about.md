## Why did you make this?

Chatbots are all over the internet engaging potential customers, driving sales, and providing customer support. A typical chatbot might provide a frictionless system for a customer to seek initial answers about a company's product, funnel them to the appropriate salesperson, then provide support for the customer if they ever have an issue with the product after purchase. All these tasks are crucial for acquiring and retaining customers but are usually not cost-effective when using real humans.

In the job market, you are the product and employers are your customers. The interview process is your chance to make a sale, but your time is valuable; you shouldn't have to waste it repeating the same pitch about your experience and education on dozens of phone screens that never lead to a real interview. This site provides a proof-of-concept for a chatbot that automates these tiresome first steps in the interview process using a personalized chatbot.

To be candid, I do not expect this to catch on. As effective as they are at scale, chatbots are *super annoying* in real life. My real goal here is to impress potential employers and demonstrate my ability to build a technically complex project from the ground up. To that end, I will make the source code for this chatbot open source and will publish freely-accessible notebooks detailing how I designed, implemented, and iterated on this project. If you are inspired by my project and would like to implement your own interview bot, you can learn more about what you can and can't do with my work [here](/copyright).
