## What can I do with your work and why?

The contents of this site and the instructional notebooks that accompany it are copyright 2022 by the author, Max Tarlov. But don't worry: I have created a mirror of the source code for the chatbot under the M.I.T. open source license on [a different GitHub repository](https://github.com/maxTarlov/interview-bot-source).

I strongly believe in open source software, not least because it allows people like you and me to learn how other people are building cool things and to build cool things ourselves. I hope people will study my code, modify it, and share what they have done with it; the most important way for me to encourage that is to open source it. There is a finite number of ways to write sane computer code and it would be unfair for me to expect people to study my code and then figure out some other way to accomplish the same thing.

However, natural language writing is different from code. There are an infinite number of ways to convey the same message in writing, and I think it *is* fair for me to expect others not to plagiarize how I convey my message here. To guard against that, I have retained the copyright to this site and the text cells of the accompanying instructional notebooks. This is not to say that you can never use my writing; if you would like to license part or all of my site or notebooks, please fill out the contact form below. Depending on what you want to do with my work, chances are that I will provide you with the license for free&mdash;__but you must ask first__.
